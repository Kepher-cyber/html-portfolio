  <hr />
<p>My name is Kepher Ashitakaya and I am 70% water like everybody else. I am a web developer, digital marketer and a mechatronics engineer. I also have a passion for aviation and to be specific being a pilot. Today I am here to talk about my carrer in programming and how it started. In all honesty, I got into programming because of the money. I heard stories of software developers raking in millions while working from home. I mean who wouldn't such a lifestyle? The interesting part is most of them were relatively young. There were a lot of avenues to choose from. There is no set path into which one must follwo to become a software developer or a web developer. The journey is reallly interesting and incredibly difficult especially for self-taught developers like me. You need an immense amount of dedication, discipline and hard work. Through this journey I have been able to learn quite a lot and appreciate the process of building something from scratch. Nothing comes easy in life and as the saying goes "Easy come, easy goes." I beleive it it paramount that everybodywho wants to delve into this career should be patient while learning and honing in on their craft. Patience is the name of the game as your time will surely come.</p>

<p>To cut to the chase, I started my journey by learning web development. Mastering the basics of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. These are the founfations of a webpage and I cannot stress enought how fundamental they are. Try to become a guru in these and you will never struggle with web development.There are many languages to learn but I believe starung out with Python is a great idea. The language is as simple as plain English withvery easy to understand synataxes.  </p>

<p>Once you get to taste the sweet fruits of your labour you will truly appreciate your hardwork. It is going to be a treachearous path and thats why it is the road less taken. Be ready to weather the storm and emerge from failures and setbacks like a champion that you are. Remember a smooth sea never made a great sailor. Embrace the challenges as they come as they are ontly permanent. Vital lessons are learnt throught this struggles.</p>
